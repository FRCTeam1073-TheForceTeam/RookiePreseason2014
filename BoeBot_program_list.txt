BoeBot Programs listing:
1.1 – 1.4: THE BASICS  - Manipulating LEDs with basic code:
-	Turn on an LED 
-	Blink an LED 
-	Cycle LEDs 
-	Dim an LED using a for loop

2.1 – 2.2: THE BASICS – Manipulating LEDs and reading sensors
- 	Toggle an LED using the button
- 	Dim an LED using the potentiometer

3.1 – 3.4 THE BASICS, Part 3 – Manipulating the Servo motors with basic code:
-	Drive the robot a direction for x seconds 
-	Drive the robot a direction for x seconds, then back y seconds 
-	Toggle the Servos using the button
-	Control the speed of the robot using a potentiometer 

4.1 – 4.2 MODERATE Programs – Using more sensors, and more complex functions:
-	Drive the robot until the ultrasonic sees a wall 
-	While drive the robot, display an led (pattern) and have and speaker beep when the robot sees a wall 

5.1 – 5.4 DIFFICULT Programs – Utilize the line following sensors and do more complex tasks with the ultrasonic
-	Have the robot drive forward until it detects a change in values (black line)
-	Have the robot follow a line using the line following sensors
-	Have the robot follow a line using the line following sensors and calibrate itself (determine its own black/white values)
-	Have the robot drive forward until it sees a wall, and then determine which direction is clear and travel that direction

6.1 FINAL CHALLENGE Programs – Using multiple sensors and what has been learned in the previous lessons, application of knowledge for complex tasks
-	Still in progress (being developed)
	Probably going to be: Create a remote control BoeBot that is capable of traveling based on registered keystrokes through PuTTy, and provide (toggle-able) sensor feeds to the driver (Ex. Turn on/off distance sensor feed, etc)
