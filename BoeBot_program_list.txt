BoeBot Programs listing:
1.1 – 1.4: THE BASICS  - Manipulating LEDs with basic code:
-	Turn on an LED 
-	Blink an LED 
-	Cycle LEDs 
-	Dim an LED using a for loop
2.1 – 2.2: THE BASICS – Manipulating LEDs and reading sensors
- Toggle an LED using the button
- Dim an LED using the potentiometer
-
3.1 – 3.4 THE BASICS, Part 3 – Manipulating the Servo motors with basic code:
-	Drive the robot a direction for x seconds 
-	Drive the robot a direction for x seconds, then back y seconds 
-	Toggle the Servos using the button
-	Control the speed of the robot using a potentiometer 
4.1	– 4.2 MODERATE Programs – Using more sensors, and more complex functions:
-	Drive the robot until the ultrasonic sees a wall 
-	While drive the robot, display an led (pattern?) and have the pattern change (and speaker beep?) when the robot sees a wall 
5.1 – 5.2 MODERATE Programs, Part 2 – Using the line following sensors (need to be mounted
-	Have the robot drive forward until it detects a change in values (black line)
-	Have the robot follow a line using one of the line following sensors
6.1 – 6.3 DIFFICULT Programs – Using multiple sensors and what has been learned in the previous lessons, application of knowledge for complex tasks
-	Use both line sensors to follow a line
-	Use both line sensors to follow a line AND have the robot calibrate the sensors itself (instead of recording value and using it as limit in code).
-	Using the ultrasonic, have the robot drive until it sees something AND then check the directions around it (turn for x seconds…), then travels down the clear path
ULTRA CHALLENGE  (7.1) 
Create a remote control BoeBot that is capable of traveling based on registered keystrokes through PuTTy, and provide (toggle-able) sensor feeds to the driver (Ex. Turn on/off distance sensor feed, etc)
